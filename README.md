- Provide actionable recommendations to inform strategic decisions.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Python** (Pandas, Numpy, MatPlotlib)
- **PowerPoint** (for presentation of findings)

## Analytical Process
1. **Data Import & Exploration**: Initial understanding of the dataset's structure and content.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Ensuring data quality by removing negative values and outliers.
3. **Data Transformation**: Preparing data through merging, aggregation, and formatting.
4. **Insights Extraction**: Analyzing data to generate actionable business insights, including occupancy rates and specific queries from the team.
